# DSA - Data Structure and Algorithm
# Data Structure is a collection of data, the relationship amoung them and the operations
# that can be applied on that data
# orgranizing the data
# managing the data

# (bricks,cement,rodes,woods) -> supervisor -> building 
# (ds)                        -> code       -> software

# Algorithm
# step by step procedure to solve a problem efficiently

# Array ----> List

# List
# -> it is used to store collection of same/different types of data
# -> fetch the data 
# -> insert the data at specify position 
# -> remove the data 

lst = [] # [6,7,1,2,4,5]
# lst.append(6)
lst.extend([6,7,1,2,4,5])
lst.insert(2,10)
lst.remove(4)
print(lst)
